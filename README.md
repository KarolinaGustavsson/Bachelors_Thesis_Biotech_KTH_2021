The repository consists mainly of code for principal component analysis and code for multiple hypothesis testing. The code for multiple hypothesis testing was adopted from code from the course CB2030 Systems Biology (https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/CB2030?l=en). The jupyter notebook https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/KrishnaswamyLab/MAGIC/blob/master/python/tutorial_notebooks/bonemarrow_tutorial.ipynb was used as well for the MAGIC workflow.
